                Welcome to Steam Sales! <br>
                This is my INST377 project that tells users the best
                updates and deals on games that go on sale on Steam. 
                Navigating through Steam you can look for a variety of games 
                but it could get too broad and overwhelming. 
                With my website you are able to view the top steam sales all in one place!
